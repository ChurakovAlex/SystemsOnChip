2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_sys_clk and clk_out1_sys_clk_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_sys_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_sys_clk_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_sys_clk_1 and clk_out1_sys_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_sys_clk_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_sys_clk]
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell sigma/reset_sync/reset_syncbuf[3]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) sigma/reset_sync/reset_syncbuf_reg[0]/PRE, sigma/reset_sync/reset_syncbuf_reg[1]/PRE, sigma/reset_sync/reset_syncbuf_reg[2]/PRE, sigma/reset_sync/reset_syncbuf_reg[3]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sigma/sigma_tile/ram/ram_dual/ram_reg_0, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sigma/sigma_tile/ram/ram_dual/ram_reg_1, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sigma/sigma_tile/ram/ram_dual/ram_reg_2, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#4 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sigma/sigma_tile/ram/ram_dual/ram_reg_3, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#5 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sigma/sigma_tile/ram/ram_dual/ram_reg_4, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#6 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sigma/sigma_tile/ram/ram_dual/ram_reg_5, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#7 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sigma/sigma_tile/ram/ram_dual/ram_reg_6, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#8 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance sigma/sigma_tile/ram/ram_dual/ram_reg_7, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#1 Warning
