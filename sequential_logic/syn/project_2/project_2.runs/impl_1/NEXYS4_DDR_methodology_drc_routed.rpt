2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_sys_clk and clk_out1_sys_clk_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_sys_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_sys_clk_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_sys_clk_1 and clk_out1_sys_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_sys_clk_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_sys_clk]
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell reset_sync/reset_syncbuf[3]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) reset_sync/reset_syncbuf_reg[0]/PRE, reset_sync/reset_syncbuf_reg[1]/PRE, reset_sync/reset_syncbuf_reg[2]/PRE, reset_sync/reset_syncbuf_reg[3]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
